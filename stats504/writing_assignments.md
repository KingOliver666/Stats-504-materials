1. (January 27th) Write a memo documenting a specific research question
that can be addressed using the BHHT (Brief History of Human Time) data,
the methods that you use to address this question, and your findings.
Your question and approach should align with the material presented in the
course lecture, focusing either on the lifespans or representation of people based
on their reported characteristics.  For this first assignment, you can
borrow generously from the findings and code discussed in class, but
aim to report at least one novel finding.

2. (February 10th) Write a memo based on your analysis of the natality
data.

3. (February 24th) Write a memo based on your analysis of the NHANES data.

1. (September 19th) Write a memo discussing a research question that can
be addressed using methods for analysis of extremes as discussed in class, using
rainfall data from the [NCDC](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/daily-summaries).
You can use the Ann Arbor data discussed in class or the data for any other locations
or locations.  Your question and approach should align with the material presented in
class.  For this first assignment, you can borrow generously from the findings and code discussed in class, but
aim to report at least one novel finding.

2. (October 3rd) Write a memo discusing a research question that can be
addressed using the natality data discussed in class.  Your question and
approach should broadly align with the material discussed in lectures, but
should incude some original ideas as well.  Your memo should reflect
your own understanding and interpretation of the methods that you use
and the findings that you obtain.

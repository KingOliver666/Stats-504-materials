1. (January 27th) Write a memo documenting a specific research question
that can be addressed using the BHHT (Brief History of Human Time) data,
the methods that you use to address this question, and your findings.
Your question and approach should align with the material presented in the
course lecture, focusing either on the lifespans or representation of people based
on their reported characteristics.  For this first assignment, you can
borrow generously from the findings and code discussed in class, but
aim to report at least one novel finding.

2. (February 10th) Write a memo based on your analysis of the natality
data.

3. (February 24th) Write a memo based on your analysis of the NHANES data.

4. (March 13th) Write a memo discussing power and study design for the following
situation.  A researcher wishes to evaluate the factors that will predict whether students
in an on-line course complete more quizzes.  The course involves 10 quizzes, and a student
has probability
$p(x, z, j) = 1 / (1 + \exp(-\beta_0 - \beta_1x - \beta_2z - \beta_3j - \beta_4xj))$
of completing the $j^{\rm th}$ quiz, for $j=1, \ldots, 10$,
where $x$ and $z$ are covariates.  The covariates can be taken to be marginally
standardized, and the correlation between them is $r_{xz}$.  It is anticipated
that students are less likely to complete the quizzes that occur later in the course
(larger values of $j$).  The key research question is whether the characteristic
measured by $x$ is associated with steeper decline in $p(x, z, j)$ with increasing $j$.
There are two additional factors to consider.  First, the response data $y_{ij}$
(the indicator that student $i$ completes quiz $j$) are correlated, but little
is known about the strength of correlation.  Second,
each student drops out of the course after taking quiz $j$ with probability $q_j$
(after dropping out of the course, the student will not take any more quizzes).  It
is expected that $q_j$ is increasing in $j$ and the probability of not dropping out
at all is $0.5$.

5. (March 23rd) Write a memo based on your analysis of the Plantnet data.

6. (April 7th) Write a memo based on your analysis of the Argo data.

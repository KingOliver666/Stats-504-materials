## Overview

This is both an applied statistics and a technical communications course,
and is intended for second year students in the Applied Statistics
and Data Science master's programs.  Students taking this course should
already have completed master's level courses in probability, theoretical
statistics, regression analysis, and multivariate statistics.

The goals of the course are as follows:

* Provide experience conducting data analyses through case studies
  drawn from multiple domains.

* Provide multiple opportunities to write about statistical findings
  and receive feedback.

* Provide exposure to new statistical methods and theoretical
  concepts.

* Provide hands-on experience working with data and implementing
  analyses.

## Format:

The lectures will be balanced between informal discussion and more formal
lectures introducing new areas and unfamiliar ideas.  Regular attendance
and participation is expected.  This is an in-person seminar-style course
and lectures will not be recorded or streamed.

## Course materials

Course materials will be available through the course github site
[here](https://github.com/kshedden/case_studies).  There is no textbook
for this course.  Grades and announcements will use the course canvas
site.

## Coursework

The coursework will entirely take the form of individual writing
assignments. There will be approximately 8 writing assignments, one for
each case study.  Each writing assignment will be 2-3 pages in length
and will resemble a memo prepared by a professional data analyst,
summarizing methods and findings from a data analysis.

Each writing assignment will address a writing prompt provided by
the instructor.  You will have significant latitude in your approach,
but the analyses are not completely open-ended -- you should focus on
addressing the issues raised in the writing prompt and in most cases
you will be asked to use a specific analytic approach in your analysis.

Writing for this course is relatively short and focused.  The text
component of a report should generally be 2-3 pages in length, with 3
pages being a hard limit.  You will generally be expected to include
one graph in each report.  Graphs and tables do not count toward the
page limit, and you should only include graphs and tables that directly
contribute to your main claims.

There are no exams in this course.

## Using Google docs

Writing assignments will be submitted using Google Docs using default
formatting (fot size, margins, etc.). Please use
your University of Michigan user account when creating these files,
and use default fonts and margins.  To facilitate grading, you must
title each document in the form “uniqname stats 504 assignment
X”, where “uniqname” is your UM login id and X=1, 2, ... is the
assignment number.  Share all your assignments with the instructor and
GSI (but please do not send us an email notification when you share
the document).  You should not edit any assignment after the due date,
note that all edits are tracked in Google Docs. Instructors will provide
feedback directly on your Google Doc.  Do not remove or unshare these
documents until the course is complete and final grades have been awarded.

## Case studies and datasets

The case studies will cover a variety of areas of inquiry in domains
including human health, social and behavioral science, natural science,
and industry/commerce. We will spend approximately three lectures
discussing the background and relevant statistical issues associated
with each case study. After this context is provided, you will be given
a writing prompt and will have approximately 10 days two prepare your
report.  Extensions will be given only in extreme situations.

## Computing

Students should be competent in data manipulation and data analysis
based on skills learned in previous courses. Model code
will be provided, but students are expected to be resourceful in terms
of data manipulation, writing and debugging code, and implementing
algorithms. Code is not submitted or graded and you are free to use any
computing environment and software that you like. Model code will be
provided in R, Python, and/or Julia.

Many of the datasets used in this course will be large.  In addition to
statistical analyses, substantial data manipulations will be required.

## Collaboration and academic honesty

Every report that you write for this class should reflect your own
independently-developed ideas.  Each student must complete their own
analysis and writing, but you may discuss analysis strategies and coding
issues with other students. Each student should develop and maintain
their own code to conduct the analysis in each project.

In the submitted writings, plagiarism from the instructor's lectures,
course materials, other students, or from any non-acknowledged source is
a serious violation of academic integrity and will result at minimum in
a score of zero on the assignment, and may also be referred to the LSA
or Rackham Honor Council.

You may use large language models (e.g. chatGPT) to assist in your writing and you
do not need to acknowledge this.  However note that the current generation
of LLMs has a simplistic and superficial "understanding" of applied statistics,
and therefore will do a poor job of meeting the expectations of this course.
You writing is expected to build on the ideas discussed in lectures,
and no LLM is aware of what we cover in our lectures.

## Grading

Your course grade will be an unweighted average of scores received on
all submitted assignments. Each assignment will be scored according to
the following rubric:

* Focus (25 points): Does the report primarily contain analysis
and interpretation of results?  Is the report focused on a single
clearly-stated question? Is the analysis goal clearly and explicitly
stated and motivated?

* Methods/approach (25 points): Is the analytic approach appropriate?
Are analytic decisions justified?  Are strengths and limitations of
the chosen approaches adequately discussed?  Are all analysis methods
adequately documented so that the analysis can be reproduced?

* Writing/organization (25 points): Is the writing well-organized,
straightforward to read, and accessible to the intended audience?  Is
statistical terminology used appropriately and defined where appropriate?
Does the report have an informative title?  Does the report include one
informative graph if appropriate?

* Findings/interpretation (25 points): Does the analysis provide
insight related to the primary motivating question?  Are the conclusions
stated explicitly and supported by the analysis and reported results?
Are findings appropriately qualified?

## Some major themes of this course are:

* Formulating meaningful and tractable questions based on
  research goals

* Devising, documenting, and implementing analysis strategies

* Communicating findings

* Leveraging knowledge of statistical foundations and theory when
  engaging in applied research

* Understanding the capabilities and limitations of statistical
  methods

* Understanding the value and limitations of different types of data

* Interpretation of analytic results

* Developing data manipulation and computing skills, especially for
  large and complex data sets

* Building knowledge about several applied research areas where
  data collection and analysis plays a major role

## Expectations for student writing

All statisticians must frequently communicate and document their findings
in written form.  Writing about your analytic plans and research findings
is an excellent way to organize your thoughts, strengthen your arguments,
and identify weaknesses in your claims.

The memos written in this course reflect the type of routine writing
done by data analysts in many business and academic settings.  These are
short writing assignments and are intended to document a data analysis --
they are not essays written for general audiences.  Your
writing should focus on a specific question, presenting your analysis and
findings that address that question.  You generally should
provide one paragraph motivating the research question, and this
motivating paragraph may be somewhat less technical than the remainder of the memo.
Apart from this
brief introduction, your writing should exclusively focus on analysis
and findings.

For the writing assignments in this course, you should imagine that
you are writing a memo to be read by colleagues or collaborators.
Your audience consists of people familiar with the data and scientific
or industrial context behind the data, and who are also knowledgeable
about statistics at a master's level or higher.  You do not need to
didactically review all methods that you use, but you should state
the key properties of analytic methods that justify their application,
along with any relevant limitations.

Below are some guidelines for writing in this course.  These are a few
of the most important things to keep in mind.  We will expand on this
a lot during the semester.

* Write in an appropriate academic or business tone.  Do not write
  casually, but also avoid excessively formal language.

* Organize your content so that your writing has a focused message,
  with each paragraph contributing a distinctly to this
  message.

* Each report should focus on one primary question.

* Motivate your analytic approaches in terms of fundamental ideas from
  statistics.

* Use simple, direct language.  Avoid convoluted expressions, hidden
  or needlessly subtle meanings, unusual vocabulary, and digressions
  that do not contribute to your main message.

* Express your arguments in as plain and simple terms as is practical.
  Do not write in a way that requires the reader to re-read your writing
  multiple times to understand your point.  Favor short sentences in the
  active voice with one clause, and paragraphs that focus on one topic
  and that do not extend for more than 5-6 sentences.

* Write for an audience that may include non-native English speakers.
  Avoid colloquialisms and obscure cultural references or metaphors.

* You are expected to be able to write in grammatically-correct
  English.  It is understood that there are many non-native English
  speakers in the course, and occasional minor grammatical issues will
  be overlooked.

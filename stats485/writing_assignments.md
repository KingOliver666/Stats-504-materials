1. (Due September 19th) Write a memo discussing a focused analysis of the BHHT data.  Be sure to review all course materials related
to writing in this course to ensure that you understand our expectations.

2. (Due October 3rd) Write a memo discussing a focused analysis of the mouse aging data.  You can primarily report on the analyses
discussed in class (and implemented in the code that we provide), but there should be at least a small element of your analysis that
goes beyond the code that we gave you.  As always, be sure to keep the writing tips and syllabus in mind when preparing your memo.

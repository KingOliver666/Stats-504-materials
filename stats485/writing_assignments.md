1. (February 5). Write a memo discussing a specific finding related to the frequency of extreme precipitation events that can be
addressed using methods discussed in class.

2. (February 19). Write a memo discussing a specific finding related to natality in US counties.  You should use the same data
discussed in class, and your analysis should primarily rely on methods that we discussed, but your analysis should extend or
modify the analysis in at least one way.

3. (March 11). Write a memo discussing a specific finding related to characteristics of notable people.  You should use the BHHT dataset
discussed in class, but you may consider variables beyond those that we used.  Also, your analysis should primarily rely on methods
that we discussed in class and that are demonstrated in the code that we provide you.
You should extend what we covered in class (and the code we provided) in at least one way.  As with all writing for this course, your memo should
be focused and it is probably a bad idea to attempt to cover both longevity
(survival analysis) and the relationships among characteristics (MCA).  You should choose one topic or the other, unless you can come up with
a very specific and thoughtful way to integrate the two.

4. (March 18). Write a revision of either your first or second memo (the precipitation/extremes memo or the natality/biplots/GLM memo).  You
should choose whichever memo recieved more critical feedback.  You can use your previous memo as a starting point and there is no concern
about "self plagiarism" in this case, but your revision should contain substantial changes to your previous submission, even if the gradetrs
identified few issues with your previous submission.

5. (March 25). TBA

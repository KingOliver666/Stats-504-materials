1. (Due September 19th) Write a memo discussing a focused analysis of
the BHHT data.  Be sure to review all course materials related to
writing in this course to ensure that you understand our expectations.

2. (Due October 3rd) Write a memo discussing a focused analysis of the
mouse aging data.  You can primarily report on the analyses discussed
in class (and implemented in the code that we provide), but there
should be at least a small element of your analysis that goes beyond
the code that we gave you.  As always, be sure to keep the writing
tips and syllabus in mind when preparing your memo.

3. (Due October 17th) Write a memo discussing a focused analysis of
the precipitation data.  Be sure to keep the writing tips in mind when
preparing your memo.  You can (and should) largely center your
analysis around the methods discussed in class, but there should be at
least something in your analysis that goes beyond what we discussed in
class.

4. (Due October 28th) Revise or rewrite either your first or second
memo.  This will be assessed as an independent submission, graded by a
different person than your original submission.  You should keep the
feedback you received on your earlier submission in mind, but just as
important is to meet all the standards expressed in the writing tips
and course syllabus.

5. (Due November 8th) Write a memo discussing a focused analysis of
the natality data.  You should largely focus on the themes discussed
in class but there should be some novelty to your approach as well.
As always, be sure to keep the writing tips and syllabus in mind
as you prepare your memo.

6. (Due November 18th) Write a memo discussing an analysis of
the Argo data.  You should largely focus on the themes discussed
in class but there should be some novelty to your approach as well.
As always, be sure to keep the writing tips and syllabus in mind
as you prepare your memo.
